# Churn Modeling Project

## Overview
Churn modeling is a predictive analytics technique used to identify customers who are likely to stop using a company's products or services. By analyzing historical data like demographics, usage patterns, subscription details, and complaints, businesses can predict potential churn and take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Objective
The main goal of this project is to:
- Predict which customers are at risk of leaving.
- Help businesses implement targeted retention strategies.
- Reduce customer attrition and improve long-term profitability.

## Dataset
The dataset typically contains customer information such as:
- CustomerID
- Age
- Gender
- Tenure
- Service usage patterns
- Monthly charges
- Number of complaints
- Churn (Yes/No)

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather customer-related data from databases or CSV files.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identify key features impacting churn.
4. **Model Building**: Train machine learning models like:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees / Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting / XGBoost
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
6. **Actionable Insights**: Predict high-risk customers and plan retention strategies.
